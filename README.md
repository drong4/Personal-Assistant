# Personal-Assistant
I made this Android app for the final project of my programming studio class. This app is intended to be a much simpler version of an artificial intelligence personal assistant, like Siri or Alexa. The main purpose of making this app was for me to learn more about Android development and how AI personal assistants were implemented.

  ## Functionality

    ### Text Messaging
    Saying the voice command "send text to <CONTACT>" where <CONTACT> is a name of a contact on the phone will make the app prompt the user for more information. If the app can't find <CONTACT> in the contacts, it will notify the user and tell them to try again. Otherwise, it'll prompt the user for the message. The app will repeat the desired message to the user to make sure that it's correct. After the user confirms, the text message is sent out.
    
    ### Weather
    Saying the voice command "what's the weather in <CITY>" where <CITY> is the name of a city will result in the app trying to get the weather conditions at the time at that place and repeat it back. If it can't, it'll notify the user to try again with a valid city name.
